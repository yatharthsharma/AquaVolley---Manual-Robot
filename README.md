# AquaVolley---Manual-Robot

This is a short video of the manual underwater maneuvering robot which won the 2nd price at KSHITIJ 10,IIT KHARAGPUR TECHFEST.

My foray in the field of robotics started with this project which luckily won big at IIT Kharagpur. There were around 150 team from all over India and we came second.

This underwater maneuvering robot was created with household items - PVC pipes ,sieve to capture the balls. There were 4 propellers - 2 for horizontal movement and 2 for vertical.
